	* nand.h: Rationalise interface:
	  * read_page: now only reads a whole page and/or its spare.
	  * read_part_page: Created.  Allows part-pages and optionally
	    not checking ECC.
	  * write_page: now only writes a whole page and/or its spare.
	  + nand_ecc.h: Drop earlier attempt to support sub-page ECC.
	* tests/readwrite.c: Test out cyg_nand_read_part_page().
	* tests: Update for interface tweak.

2009-11-06  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* nand_ecc_mtd_fast.c: Created. Complete rewrite of software 
	ECC for massive performance boost. In summary, use all 32 bits
	of a register at once, and part-unroll the operation. (Also
	rewrote the ecc repair function to drop the dependency on the
	previous (imported) code.
	* tests: Update to suit the above.
	* tests/eccequiv.c: Created (used to test new ECC implementation).

2009-10-28  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* nand.cdl, nand.c, nand_bbt.[ch]: CYGSEM_IO_NAND_USE_BBT
	implemented (default on).  Updated tests and utils to suit.
	* nand.cdl: Add convenience options to build the utils as well
	as the tests.
	* tests/sweccwalk.c: Created (software ECC bit-walker and repair
	consistency checks)
	* nand.sgml: Updated for the above. Documented ECC algorithm
	interface.
	* tests/rwbenchmark.c: Have rwbenchmark use randomised test data
	and check its work for better validity.

2009-10-08  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* nand_ecc.h, nand.c, nand_ecc_mtd.c: Expand ECC interface
	to better allow hardware assistance.
	* nand_device.h, nand.cdl: Change function set ("v2"), add cdl marker
	* nand.c: Implement v2 read/write, updated devinit
	* nand.c, nand_bbt.h: Internally expose "raw" page read/write fns
	* nand_oob.c, nand_oob.h: Create packed_{read,write} fns
	* nand_bbt.c: Use raw page read/write fns, packed read/write fns
	- and sanity test them on startup
	* nand.sgml: Document driver interface change.
	* rwbenchmark.c: Check that we read the requisite amount of data.

2009-09-28  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* tests: Don't put large arrays on stack.

2009-08-28  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* doc/nand.sgml: Update. Split entries for NAND device drivers out into
	their individual driver packages.
	* tests: Moved bbt.c and multipagebbt.c into devs/nand/synth/

2009-07-28  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* utils: Add erasenand.c; build fix erase_bbt_dangerous.c

2009-07-21  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* nand_bbt.c: Fix BBT initialisation bug

2009-07-17  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* nand.sgml: Prep for inclusion in docbuilds

2009-07-09 Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* nand_bbt.c: Fix corner case arising from a write failure on a BBT block.

2009-07-02 Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* tests: Add rwbenchmark.c

2009-06-17 Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>
	* Global: Create a per-device lock to remove this burden from drivers.
	Retab for consistency with the rest of eCos.
	* cdl: Create CYGNUM_NAND_PAGEBUFFER; NAND drivers must impose
	requirements on this according to the largest device they support.
	Add dependency on stdlib.
	* nand.c, util.c: Add more assertions.
	* nand_app.h: Renamed to nand.h for consistency with other packages
	* nand_bbt.c: Refactor to use the pagebuffer to not be so stack-greedy.
	Properly incorporate both on-chip BBTs in case we were interrupted
	when writing out. Add more assertions.
	* nand_bbt.h: Move BLOCK2PAGEADDR and PAGE2BLOCKADDR to util.h.
	Header made internal.
	* nand_ecc.h: Rename ECCPERPAGE to CYG_NAND_ECCPERPAGE.
	* nand_oob.h: Rename NAND_APPLICATION_OOB to CYG_NAND_APPLICATION_OOB,
	similarly for OOB_MAX_ECC_SLOTS and OOB_MAX_APP_SLOTS.
	* doc: Linewrap for consistency
	* tests: Tweak to make more likely to work in a minimal config.
	Move mkvector.c and ar4test.c into misc/.
	bbt doesn't mandate synth.
	eccdamage moved to synth.

2009-06-02 Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* cyg_nand_init: Removed in toto, in favour of a static constructor.
	* Global: Replaced all use of diag_printf with new NAND_ERROR macro.

2009-06-01 Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/util.c include/util.h: Created

2009-03-02 Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* New package. NAND flash access library.
