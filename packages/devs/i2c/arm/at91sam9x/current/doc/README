Preliminary documentation for AT91SAM9X I2C driver
===================================================

This Driver hasn't been tested on any AT91SAM9X based board.

ADDING A DEVICE
================
    A device is added to the system using macro

    CYG_I2C_AT91SAM9X_DEVICE(name, cyg_i2c_bus* i2c_bus, cyg_uint16 i2c_address
        cyg_uint16 i2c_flags, cyg_uint32 i2c_delay, cyg_uint8 int_addr_sz);

    Usage of this macro is similar to using CYG_I2C_DEVICE except the last
    argument int_addr_sz, which is extra.
        
        name           
        i2c_bus         :-  This specifies the bus which this device is 
                            connected to.Here it is a pointer to 
                            "cyg_i2c_at91sam9x_bus".

        i2c_address     :-  This is 7 bit I2C address of the device.

        i2c_flags       :-  This flag is not used presently.

        i2c_delay       :-  This is the clock period which should be used when 
                            interacting with the device, in nanoseconds.

        int_addr_sz     :-  Some I2C devices (like EEPROM,FRAM etc) requires
                            internal address to access locations in it.
                            If you are using such devices you can give the
                            number of internal address bytes used.

                            WHILE USING I2C APIS THE DRIVER WILL EXPECT
                            FIRST "int_addr_sz" BYTES TO BE THE INTERNAL
                            ADDRESS OF COMMUNICATING DEVICE.
                            SIZE ARGUMENT GIVEN WILL BE TAKEN AS THE NUMBER OF
                            DATA BYTES TO BE TRANSFERRED EXCLUDING THE INTERNAL
                            ADDRESS.

                            THIS FEATURE CAN BE DISABLED BY GIVING ZERO HERE

    EXAMPLE
    =======
        
        Adding EEPROM device to the system.
            
            EEPROM specifications
                    address = 56
                    frequency = 400Khz
                    size = 64K (8132 * 8)
                    data word address (internal address) = 2 bytes
    
    Adding this eeprom to the system will be like given below

            CYG_I2C_AT91SAM9X_DEVICE(cyg_i2c_at91_dev_eeprom,
                    &cyg_i2c_at91sam9x_bus, 0x56, 0x00, 2500, 2);
